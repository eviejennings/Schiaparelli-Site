        All of us who work in fashion know that much of the rest of the world
        thinks that what we do is silly. It's a boring criticism, and we all
        argue otherwise, but if you think about it, fashion is silly at times.
        It's also provocative, upending, challenging, and meaningful. It's
        breathtaking. It's beautiful. <br />
